**Legal Tactics & Administrative Tricks from the Backend of Swedish Kitchens**

AfterShift.se is an independent archive of real-world documents, strategies, and observations from within Sweden’s kitchen industry — primarily in Malmö and Stockholm.  
This site is not about complaining. It is not about politics. It is not about nostalgia.  
It is about **showing what was done**: actions taken, tools used, responses received, and pressure applied.  

No theory. Just documented facts.

## 🎯 Purpose

- To **share real documents** (contracts, emails, payslips, screenshots, letters to government institutions).
- To demonstrate **the strategic use of legal and administrative tools** by one individual, acting alone.
- To reveal how pressure can be **legitimately and effectively applied**, without needing a lawyer.
- To showcase how **social services, unemployment agencies, and employers** respond in real cases.
- To build an **open knowledge base** for anyone who has worked a shift and wonders what’s possible.

## 🔍 What You Will Find

- **Chronicles** of actual events — time-stamped, structured, documented.
- Screenshots of communication with **HRAK, Arbetsförmedlingen**, and social services.
- Letters of demand and employer responses.
- Tools used to collect evidence (Body Battery logs, Google Maps timeline, etc.).
- Annotated documents that **show rather than tell** what happened.
- A local but scalable method: **one person, a handful of tools, and a sharp sense of timing**.

## 👤 Who Is It For?

- Dishwashers and kitchen staff in Sweden.
- Former workers who’ve experienced **grey zones or irregular contracts**.
- Individuals facing administrative opacity — and **seeking strategy, not sympathy**.
- Legal professionals looking for **an honest, first-hand archive of contemporary kitchen work**.
- Anyone who knows that real power lies in documentation, timing, and tactics.

## 🧠 Tone & Intent

- Not a political blog.
- Not a worker’s movement.
- Not a cry for help.
- It is a **cold mirror**. A tactical logbook.  
  **I am not giving advice — I am showing what I did.**
